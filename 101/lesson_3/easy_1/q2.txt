# What is != and where should you use it?
!= means 'not equal' you would use it to test if two values are not equal to each other

# put ! before something, !user_name
Unless user_name was nil or false, the above would return true.
! behind something returns the opposite of it's boolean value
e.g. !5 returns false, as 5 is truthy.

# puts ! after something, like words.uniq!
In most cases ! after a method call indicates a destructive method. 
One that mutates the caller. 

# put ? before something
? before something ... not sure. The ternary ?: operator is all I know of

# puts ? after something
directly after a method name this would suggest that the method returns a boolean.
otherwise it's probably part of the?: ternary operator.

# put !! before something
Return it's boolean value !!true returns true
!!false returns false !!5 returns true
