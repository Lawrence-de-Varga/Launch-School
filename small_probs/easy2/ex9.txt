# String assignment
name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name.upcase!
puts name, save_name

outputs -> BOB
           BOB

This works because upcase! modifies the actual object not a copy. 
name and save_name both point to the same space in memory 
which is the object modified by upcase! 
So after having called upcase! the object in memory is modified 
and both name and save_name point to the new object.
